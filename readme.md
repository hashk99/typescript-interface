By design, typescript interfaces cannot hold private or protected propeties.

## Examples

`ChildClass.ts` file contains the first solution. Interface can extend a class which can use to keeps the private and protected propeties.

`ChildClass2.ts` file contains the second solution. Abstract class holds the private and protected variables.

You can run them by:
 ``node ChildClass2.js`` OR  ``node ChildClass.js``
